# Skullgirls
This is my Advanced JavaScript project featuring trivia from the Skullgirls mobile and cross-platform fighter game!

I had previous HTML projects where I wanted to work on Skullgirls, so some of the code I wrote last semester has been re-used from my previous projects.

This trivia website includes a good number of game fighters (but not the entirety of them for deadline purposes)!
